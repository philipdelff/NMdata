#+PROPERTY: LOGGING nil
#+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w) DONE(d)
* NMdata todo
** Design
*** DONE Add version to welcome message
*** DONE All arguments should be arg.foo rather than argFoo
*** TODO [#B] deprecate "default" option in NMdataConf
    has no benefit over NULL, so redundant and prevents the use of
    "default" as an actual param value.
*** DONE Allow for say input.txt/output.txt
**** NMtransInput
*** TODO [#B] Support a drop argument
It has been initiated in the code. I believe it can be finished after
the translate part. The colnames table is the trickier part to update.
*** DONE Support for return as tibble or whatever
Could we use an option, NMdata.return="dplyr::as.tibble" which could then be
reached and applied from within NMdata? It would have to not create extra
dependencies. This solution is being tested on pmxtricks.
*** DONE Where does NMcode2R belong?
It is needed in NMdata but should it be exported from NMdata?
Conclusion: export from pmxtricks, internal in NMdata.
*** DONE Check assign by ref inside package
 copyOrNot <- function(data){
     data[,newcol:=1]
     }
With load_all():
> dt1 <- data.table(a=1)
> dt1
   a
1: 1
> r1=copyOrNot(dt1)
> dt1
> dt1
   a newcol
1: 1      1
*** DONE messageWrap internal/external
    This is called track.msg
    
    The mentioning of where a message comes from is only useful if a
    function is called from other functions. Possible to distinguish
    somehow?
** High level features
*** DONE Support for DATE type columns
** New functions
*** document columns
**** TODO Check for existence of char column in values
If a data.frame specifies the num/char relationship, the char column
should not be present in data. That would at least be a warning.
**** TODO A regex argument to search for character values
**** TODO Additional standard Nonmem columns 
RATE,II, ADDL
**** TODO addTAPD columns
**** TODO If specified variable does not exist, send a message
*** xml processer
library(XML)
XML::xmlParse("models/run1005_hi005.xml") |> xmlToList()
*** DONE Remove commas from character strings
Added editCharCols

The following code does not look at column names

#+begin_src R
## get rid of commas in character values
cnames.char <- colnames(nmdat)[ !sapply(nmdat,function(x)NMisNumeric(x)||"POSIXct"%in%class(x)||is.factor(x))]
## character columns are edited removing commas from strings in all elements (contents of columns, not names)
nmdat[,(cnames.char):=lapply(.SD,function(x)gsub(",","",x)),.SDcols=cnames.char]
## factors are checked for commas in strings but not edited (because then factor levels would be lost)
cnames.fac <- colnames(nmdat)[ !sapply(nmdat,function(x)NMisNumeric(x)||"POSIXct"%in%class(x))&sapply(nmdat,function(x)is.factor(x))]
if(any(nmdat[,sapply(.SD,function(x)any(grepl(",",x))),.SDcols=cnames.fac])) stop("commas found in factors. This will cause problems when reading data into NONMEM. Please fix.")
#+end_src

*** TODO [#B] function to add variables to $TABLE               :newFunction:
**** Which $TABLE to add to?
*** CANCELLED NMfreezeModels                                    :newFunction:
    Remember to add chmod and describe that only a flat dir structure is supported so far

    Since NMexec archives input data, this is no longer necessary
*** DONE function to replace file name extension - fnExtension
*** DONE summary.NMdata
*** DONE Summary of the columns - NMinfo
    right now hidden in metadata
*** DONE Summary of tables - NMinfo
*** TODO [#B] A function that defines NULL variables            :newFunction:
    Risk now is that arguments are set to NULL
    Export to parent. Not sure check allows though...
** Function improvements
*** addTAPD
**** TODO [#A] Add subset.data arg like in flags functions
**** DONE Rename NDOSES to DOSCUMN
It aligns with DOSCUMA and it is clearer from DOSCUMN that its
cumulative number of doses.
**** TODO [#B] DOSTOTN could be total number of doses.
Not to be added by default
**** TODO [#B] DOSTOTA could be total dose amount.
Not to be added by default
**** DONE Bug in DOSCUMA
If a sim rec is simultaneos to, occurring below in data, and
order.event-ordered before first dose, DOSCUMA comes out wrong.

No, this is correct. DOSCUMA initiates at 0. I was confused because
other returned columns zre NA, but DOSCUMA and NDOSES are 0 when no
doses have been given. Correct.
**** DONE Not evaluated at dose times for other doses than captured by subset
**** DONE add suffix and prefix arguments
prefix="N" for nominal or suffix="R" and suffix="CMT==5" for rescue
medication.
**** DONE add SDOSE argument
which scales AMT to DOSE variables. Sometimes AMT is say mcg but DOSE
i mg. Then also one could want PDOS etc to be in mg.

pdosamt, doscuma
**** DONE Add test of SDOS
**** TODO [#B] Quit if no doses found etc
*** cl
*** dims
**** DONE Check if objects are data.frames
*** fnAppend
**** TODO [#B] If x is a list
Apply elementwise to fn. Must be same length as fn then.
*** fnExtention
**** DONE Support strings without extensions
 Example: fnExtension("run",".lst")
**** DONE fnExtension("run.lst","") should return run
**** DONE fnExtension("run.lst") should return lst
**** DONE Make internal in tracee
*** getArgs
**** DONE Make sure functions that use it can work with lapply
Solved by alway passing call and environment
*** NMcheckColNames
**** return input column names and Nonmem interpretation for user to spot errors
**** Bad name, what could we call it?
*** cc - create character vector function
*** NMgenText
**** TODO [#A] Test variables given in until arg exist
Or only use those that do exist. Right now a strange error is returned
**** TODO Handle until values not matching column names
**** DONE Add a until argument to specify the last column to use in nonmem
**** TODO [#B] checks: duplicate column names
**** TODO [#B] test if a synonym was used. Give warning or msg if not
**** TODO [#B] test if variables are used in more than one arg
like copy, synonym etc. Doesn't make sense to use in more than one.
*** findCovs
*** compareCols
**** DONE Only print results if data.table is non-empty
**** DONE print results should be run through as.fun
The user likely wants to see the print style they work with
**** DONE Support for list.data                                     :v0_0_12:
     Same way as dims
**** DONE Bug - overview of columns is given twice
 compareCols(ex.001,ex.002,ex.005,diff.only=T) %>% print(topn=100)

No, they werent. It was the print call. But one change was made. now quiet=T suppresses all the info, so in the example above, use quiet=T to print a subset with print(topn=...).
**** DONE scope argument
     This is called columns.wanted

     Sometimes we are interested in specific columns. List these and only
these in the same order as requested. An inversion option could be
helpful. Only list other columns than the scope.
**** DONE rows are not being sorted correctly.
     Seems not to prioritize columns that only exist in one of the
     data.tables.
**** DONE Bug for diff.only=FALSE
*** editCharCols
**** DONE Add commas example
*** egdt
**** DONE BUG the tmp by col has to be removed before reporting dims
**** DONE Report dims(df1,df2,result) unless quiet
*** listMissings
List missing elements
For specific columns, look for missing elements (NA, "", length(x)==0
in case of lists?). Tabulate and list.
**** TODO Arg for row counter
For now, a new row counter is generated. But if data is filtered after
that means, one has to rerun listMissings for reference to be updated.
**** DONE If nothing found, return an empty data.table ()
**** DONE check for duplicates in columns requested to check
**** DONE Check for duplicate column names in data
**** TODO [#B] Align reporting with NMcheckData?
**** TODO [#B] dcast summary when using by
This is quite powerfull:
 dcast(missings[,.N,by=.(STUDYID,variable)],variable~STUDYID)
***** Would be even better to have zeros where columns are found and there are no NA's. 
***** Include "number of rows" in table.
      
**** DONE listMissings test                                         :v0_0_11:
**** DONE Complete documentation
     It seems like a description is missing. So is value. Explain that
     a summary is printed, and a list i invisibly returned, if that is
     what is done.
*** TODO [#B] NMasNumeric                                       :newFunction:
Error if not convertible and not NA or ""? "b" should be an error right?
*** TODO [#B] NMsummarizeData Summarize data with nonmem in mind. :newFunction:
**** Number of doses and obs per subj
**** Dist of DV
**** Covariates
**** Has to take a by arg
*** TODO [#B] NMcreateDoses Generate dosing schedule with loading, ADDL etc :newFunction:
    This is available as a suitcase function
*** TODO [#B] Function for complex dosing regimens              :newFunction:
*** DONE [#B] Function to unfold ADDL/II doses to multiple rows :newFunction:
*** mergeCheck
**** TODO [#A] Change name to addCols
Do not deprecate mergeCheck() - too much depends on it.
**** TODO [#B] Implement a faster method?
What if we just check for matches in by columns?
**** TODO [#B] accept common columns not being merged by if suffixes are provided
**** TODO [#A] If results are not accepted. Check for whether y is unique in by
**** TODO [#B] Add at least number of NA's to message about what was added
Probably add class too.
Number of unique combinations of by? This seems too advanced
4|3|2 -> 4
Numer of NA's in right and in result
**** DONE Deprecate df1 and df2 arguments                           :v0_0_11:
**** DONE Warning if NA in by columns                               :v0_0_11:
**** DONE merge in try                                              :v0_0_11:
     If the merge actually fails, we want to prepend something to the
     data.table::merge error.
**** TODO [#B] second merge in try
If first merge isn't accepted, the second merge can fail. Or is it
because by and by.x+by.y are handled differently the second time? Clen this.
**** DONE Check that by or by.x+by.y were supplied
**** DONE derive by.x and by.y from by and by.x+by.y and then use by.x and by.y
     That will make the code clearer because we will know exactly how
     the merge is done.
**** DONE Test the check for row duplications
*** NMapplyFilters
**** DONE IGN() support
***** TODO [#A] Tests missing
IGN(SUSP.NE.1) gave an error in NMscanData.
IGN=(SUSP.NE.1) gave the same error.

These seem to work in Nonmem. Find out what's allowed and test for it.

If so, give a warning
**** DONE Support for no filters
I don't think I ever tried this. What will NMscanData do if input data
has no headers, and there are no filters? I think NMapplyFilters may
fail.
*** NMcheckData
**** TODO [#A] Classify findings
NOTE, WARN, ERR -> just in table, warning(), stop()?
**** TODO [#A] Argument to disable warnings and stop?
**** DONE arg to disable looking for some columns
like CMT, AMT etc. Maybe cols.disable where only some can be chosen?
**** TODO [#A] subset argument
Remember row numbers must be true to full data set
**** TODO [#B] SS testes separately for doses and non-doses?
SS is tested to be in c(0,1) for all rows. Maybe split in two checks,
like done for RATE?
**** DONE RATE=-1 is OK
**** DONE CMT can be any non-zero integer
But more than say 20 compartments seems unlikely
**** CANCELLED Support for a table of accepted findings
**** DONE support for col.id with file arg
Looks like col.id is being overwritten for no reason
**** TODO [#B] Improve handling of missing covs
Right now, if covs="WT" is specified and WT is not a column, an error
is thrown. That should be a finding instead.
**** TODO [#B] Support for col.evid
**** DONE Should not be a finding if col.flagn is not supplied and FLAG is not found
**** DONE DV=0 in dosing records is OK
For now NA expected
**** DONE MDV can be 0, 1 or missing in non-obs events
**** TODO Allow _ in column names?
Currently, these are findings
**** TODO Allow special characters in names of columns not readable by nonmem?
**** DONE RATE must be missing or 0 for non-dose events
**** DONE Add support for simulation dataset
ID's are expected to have sim records rather than obs. And col.row not
expected. It's not used by NMsim anyway.
***** TODO What happens if they have obs too?
**** CANCELLED Look for NA's coded as "."
**** DONE Bug if no numeric cols found?
     Warning message:

Many variables are only expected to exist for say samples. Example:
LLOQ can very well be missing for doses. And the check may depend on
study, compound etc too. So we need to split or subset data for the
check. Maybe check in a subset and expect NA in the rest?
**** DONE Checks for presense of II and ADDL should report dependence
     If one is present, presence of the other is tested. If not found,
     it says "II Column not found". Would be helpful to know that it
     is because ADDL is found.
**** DONE ADDL and II: II cannot be >0 if ADDL==0

**** DONE Add support for windows absolute paths
     I don't think this was ever an issue. The regular expression used
     should match both unix and windows absolute paths.
*** NMwriteSection
**** DONE newlines as a function
If newlines is a function and location=="replace", read section, apply
function to text, then overwrite.
***** DONE Implement: newlines as a function
***** TODO [#A] tests: newlines as a function
**** DONE Support insertion of new section before or after another section
location="replace" is default. "before" and "after" should be
additional allowed values.
***** DONE Handle lists
Think about how to handle this for
lists. Maybe just OK to insert before and after with a list? Or is it
too rarely needed?
***** TODO use switch instead of if else
***** TODO Tests
**** DONE Allow to remove a section if it doesn't exist
**** DONE Put backup files in NMdata_backup
**** DONE Check if any files matched before running lapply
**** TODO [#B] When using list.files, give overview of matches by expression and by data.file

**** DONE Return data.table when working with data.table?
Do the same as mergeCheck, flagsAssign etc
*** NMextractText
**** TODO [#B] reduce lines and text to one argument
The information is sufficient when taking into account the linesep
arguement. If length(lines) and linesep is given, a warning must be
issued. Once done, NMgetSection must be updated as well.
*** NMisNumeric
**** DONE NA_character is not recognized as numeric
*** NMreadCtlPars
**** classify_matches should maintain character values, not numeric
*** NMreadExt

     Check status on this. Not sure if it's resolved already.
**** DONE Get number of subjects as before filtering
Challenge is that the filters are applied before the column names are

***** TODO [#B] TIME and related columns
 I still don't really understand the documentation on this, but it doesnt seem
 too hard to implement. It should NOT only be interpreted when the A=B format is used in

headers in output. That is not supported now. It wouldn't be hard to
include.
**** TODO [#B] Support for deriving NMREP in NOHEADER case
The replication of the row counters show - at least for full length
tables
**** DONE Split out data finder handling
There is a few different ways to get to the data file path. Some
checks are being done on the compatibility of the arguments in
NMscanData. This should be done in NMscanInput or NMextractDataFile so
that other functions such as NMcheckData gets the same behaviour.

This is now handled by NMextractDataFile
**** DONE Test on a simulation model with subproblems
**** DONE Simplify timestamp warnings
Ideally, When .mod is newer than .lst and or tables, reduce to one warning
summarizing both findings. At least, just give brief one-liners.
**** DONE nmout and model must not overwrite existing
     The can still overwrite, but a warning is thrown
**** DONE Check that no new values of col.row are found in output
**** DONE Test for disjoint ID's
     If ID's are disjoint, it's actually really easy to make a new ID
     and use that for merging firstonly. But only if a row identifier
     is used. If not the same new ID is to be added to the
     firstonly. This will need testing.
**** DONE Move time checks up
Now, if number of rows don't match in input and output, the user don't
get warnings about time. This is bad because updates to input data is
a likely reason.
**** DONE Add support for merge.by.row="ifAvailable"
**** DONE Make sure all options in NMdataConf are documented
**** DONE input file name in meta columns
***** table column should be called file
**** DONE intro translate.input argument
**** DONE method.combine to merge.by.row
     Since we only have and will only have two methods, this should be
     a binary switch between the methods.
**** DONE Check if col.row is being modified in Nonmem.
**** TODO [#B] Limitation: tables with EXCLUDE_BY
**** DONE Limitation: FIRSTLASTONLY
**** DONE Implement recoverRows using mergeByFilters
**** TODO [#B] Add support for col.row of length>1
**** DONE Consistent behaviour when missing data arguments
***** use.input (default)
****** Means that output data will be merged onto input data
****** If input data is missing or merge not possible, give warning
****** if only firstonly data available, do the merge if possible
***** mergeByFilters (defult in future?)
***** Only allowed if use.input=TRUE
***** Means that we will translate NM filters and cbind rather than using a row identifier.
***** If the filters go wrong, give error
***** Firstonly (FO) data can only be used if ID is both input and FO table
  We can implement taking the sequence of IDs from input and restore
  ID's from that
**** DONE Improve summary of what tables were used and how.
Right now it only says if input or output. Table name would be helpful.
**** TODO [#B] Support for no ID, no ROW in firstonly tables
If mergeByFilters we can take the sequence of ID in the input
data. But what if an ID comes back? I think a record is in FIRSTONLY
whenever ID changes, but test this.
**** TODO [#B] Check if ID has been corrupted by output format
check if variables are consistent within ROW: ID (others?) This is
fatal and will happen when using long ID's and non-matching format
when writing tables from Nonmem.
**** TODO [#B] New argument to define columns to read from input data
ID should be default. Maybe TIME too?
**** DONE Run NMorderColumns in the end
Remember to use what we know about col.row. 
**** DONE source for nmout and model must be internal
in var table 
**** TODO [#B] report tables that are not used
See xgxr013.lst in test_NMscanData. A firstonly table cannot be included. This
is not visible in summary because summary is based on tables in returned
data. It should be based on tables in meta$tables.
*** NMscanMultiple
**** DONE set default file pattern to all lsts
**** TODO [#A] Check if models are repeated
It now throws a weird error
**** TODO [#A] Check if input data can be reused across models
In that case, do the merge in the end
*** NMwriteData
**** TODO If NMgenText is run, results should go into metaData
**** DONE Support writing fst
***** TODO formats.read instead of use.formats
***** TODO deprecate use.rds everywhere
***** TODO handle use.rds in NMdataConf
***** DONE Stamp does not include both csv and rds
Try write.rds=T in test_NMwriteData "with stamp on csv"
**** DONE Support not writing all columns to csv
It would be faster and sometimes only feasible to use the dataset with
nonmem if columns are omitted from csv. But this is still very small
data amounts to handle with data.table so one could still want to keep
it all in rds.
**** DONE Change from write.csv, write.rds etc to formats and save
default would be formats=cc(csv,rds) if fnExtension(file)=="csv" and
if not then fnExtension(file). This aligns with tracee and is more
intuitive for using a save=writeOutput standard in scripts. Maybe
processing could be integrated with method in writeFlextab.
**** DONE Support for script=NULL
     Not sure how deep back this support is missing
**** DONE Include option for non-nonmem data
We want to write any csv or rds with meta data. Maybe just a message
instead of the current warning when flags etc arent found?

The arg is called genText
**** DONE deprecate RData
**** DONE BUG NA's are not .
does fwrite use args.fwrite at all?
**** DONE Separate generation of INPUT text into new function
     Called NMgenText
**** DONE Bug in inclusion of filename in text
     See poster example
**** TODO [#B] Include a randomly generated ID in meta data that we can check files against?
**** DONE Add support for custom fwrite arguments
**** DONE When writing a CSV, write meta data to separate file
**** DONE Support for pseudonyms
     It's called nm.rename. You can only add A in A=B.
**** DONE Check if character variables contain commas
This will cause trouble when writing csv
**** DONE Use fwrite rather than write.csv
**** TODO [#B] Improve support for custom IGNORE/ACCEPT statements
Nested statements
**** DONE Returned text should be a list of sections.
Ultimately, NMreplacePart must accept this as argument.
**** DONE The Nonmem instructions should not include character variables
**** DONE Include an argument to do =DROP
This will only affect the instructions to pass into Nonmem. If =DROP
is on a character variable, subsequent numerics can still be used in
Nonmem.
**** DONE print out dropped variables? 
Not warning. Warning if standard variable?
*** NMordercolumns
**** DONE Remove check for standard columns
     This is now done in NMcheckData instead
**** DONE Don't warn about missing SS, ADDL, II
**** DONE Polish
*** flagsAssign
**** TODO [#A] flag.c should be factor
And flagsCount should retain them
Was this supposed to be flag.c?
**** DONE flagsCount should not require a flag table
**** DONE flagsCount should throw an error if not all flags are covered by provided flag table
**** CANCELLED flagsAssign and flagsCount should not offer increasing option.
Without that we can better do flagsCount without the flag table.

**** DONE subsets of zero rows should return a message, not an error
say subset="EVID==2" will return an error if no rows found. 
***** DONE Test 
**** TODO [#B] Need to work in IDhasNoObs and IDhasNoDos
This likely means a restructure so all tables have to be given
together and these subject-level flags are set across EVID after 
**** DONE check for whether there are any contents in data - just warning and return nothing
**** DONE implement grp.incomp as in flagsCount
**** DONE Only give message about overwriting FLAG/flag if non-NA values are present
**** DONE Improve messages at each FLAG coding
**** DONE Make sure we arrange back to original order
**** DONE Introduce a way to apply to a subset only
This could be EVID==0 or maybe one study in a meta analysis

It's fairly easy to implement. Paste in front of the expression.use column.
**** DONE Can we assign FLAG=0, flag=Dosing to EVID==1?
     Or is FLAG==0 reserved?
use flagsAssign(data,subset.data="EVID==1",flagc.0="Dosing")
*** flagsCount
**** DONE Replace 0 with NA for "all avail data"
N.disc.cum and Nobs.disc.cum are zero but there is no counting to
report here
**** DONE bug in 0.0.9: Nobs.disc.cum ignores by
**** DONE OK respect decreasing or increasing order.flags
**** DONE add .cum of N and Nobs
**** DONE add argument to name "all available data" in table. 
**** DONE Add check on EVID - who wants to mix these?
**** TODO [#B] allow skipping and disabling flags.
***** For this we will need additional two columns - Nobs.matched and N.(entirely.)matched
**** TODO [#B] The function could paste an explained overview to the terminal
**** DONE Add save argument to align with other functions
*** NMdataConf
**** DONE reset=TRUE must also wipe unknown settings
**** TODO [#B] Add col.id. Generally, support for custom col.id may be missing.
**** TODO [#B] Add na.strings
     Used in NMisNumeric and NMcheckData
**** DONE test that function evaluation does not depend on global env
**** DONE Add support for add.name
**** DONE use.input
**** DONE recover.rows
**** DONE use.rds
**** DONE quiet
**** DONE col.row
This is two steps. 
***** A method.merge argument must be introduced in NMscanData
***** col.row can be non-NULL even if using cbind for combining data
**** DONE order.columns
*** stampObj
**** CANCELED Include output filename in stamp
This belong in write functions. stampObj does support extra
arguments. NMdata calls this "writtenTo".
*** summary.NMdata
**** DONE Put message about how stuff was merged after table overview :v0_0_12:
**** DONE EVID/CMT table: Switch order of output and input only and add "result" :v0_0_12:
**** DONE EVID/CMT table: add a total line (use rollup?)            :v0_0_12:
**** DONE Break down number of rows by CMT and EVID.
**** Rethink and tidy up message
***** DONE Combine first two tables
***** DONE Add number of rows
***** DONE Add result row
****** Number of columns has 0-2 extra columns
*** uniquePresent
**** DONE Document and export
** Tests and documentation

**** TODO Add bug list
**** TODO Rename menu items
**** TODO Automate Function overview from tags
** Discussion
*** recoverRows can mean mix of variable interpretations
If recoverRows and a variable is changing interpretation from input to
output, the resulting table will carry two distinct variables
depending on nmout TRUE or FALSE.
